graph-editor.js
===============

A graph editor (as in graph theory) written in JavaScript utilizing the canvas
element. Originally written to be part of the Sage computer algebra system, now
it is also a stand alone tool. The library does not pollute your JavaScript
globals, it adds only the "GraphEditor" object.
